print("Hello World")

print(int("5") + int("7"))

# how to convert string to integer - wrap it in int(" ")

# convert text to integer doesn't work - int("hello") will throw an error

# for strings where you need to include "", wrap in single ' quotes - 'She said "I want this"'
# 'She said "Don't put that there"' will throw an error

# 'She said "Don\'t Do That"'
# What "\" does is tells the interpreter to read the following character as a string - so "don\'t" would return "don't"
